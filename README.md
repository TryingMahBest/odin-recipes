# odin-recipies

The project is to make a website about recipies using basics of HTML learned till now, by having multiple webpages and images linked to it.

This is to show my understanding in utlising the concepts of utilising the html boiler-plate, paragraph and heading elements, list elements, anchor tags and image tags
